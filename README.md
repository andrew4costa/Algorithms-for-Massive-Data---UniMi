# Algorithms-for-Massive-Data---UniMi

This project was a part of the Algorithms for Massive Data Master's module at the University of Milan. The goal of the project was to classify images of plants along species and whether they possessed a disease (or not).

We adopted a two-pronged analysis. 
1) One approach was to frame the problem as a binary classification task (disease or not);
2) The second analysis was to use the dataset in its original format - as a multilabel classification problem.
